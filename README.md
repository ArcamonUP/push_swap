Here is my Push_swap project for 42 School. It is one of the first projects at the school where I learned how to manage stacks and sort two stacks in the most efficient way possible.

My code is inspired by the method described by Jamie Dawson in [this article](https://medium.com/@jamierobertdawson/push-swap-the-least-amount-of-moves-with-two-stacks-d1e76a71789a), though I have implemented a few differences.

Here is how I proceeded : [My method](https://medium.com/@kilfenbaridon/how-to-over-optimize-an-algorithm-push-swap-42-school-project-d01a50e5fd78) (Medium)

My benchmark is :
- Average of 592 operations on 100 numbers (project allow a maximum of 700)
- Average of 4903 operations on 500 numbers (project allow a maximum of 5500)
